# solarthing-web
The web app to show how much power is being used at Wild Mountain Farms

This backend reads data from a serial port on an Outback MATE, and uploads it to a CouchDB
database. This web application accesses that CouchDB database and displays the data
from FX's and MX's.

See the backend here: https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing
